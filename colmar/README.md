Codecademy Colmar Academy Final Project

For our capstone project of the Codecademy HTML/CSS 10-week course at http://ready.codecademy.com we were given a wireframe image of the landing site as well as graphics assets to use. We were asked to create the site and apply styling and responsive design.

Here is the wireframe:
