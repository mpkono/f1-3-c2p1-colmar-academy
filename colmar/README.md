Codecademy Colmar Academy Final Project - Working Draft

For our capstone project of the Codecademy HTML/CSS 10-week course at http://ready.codecademy.com we were given a wireframe image of the landing site as well as graphics assets to use. We were asked to create the site and apply styling and responsive design. This is my working draft. I still have time before I need to submit the project, so I will use that time to apply some additional polish and cleanup.

Here is the wireframe:
